# Numerical Methods
Three Matlab projects made for Numerical Methods course.
## Usage
To run scripts included in this project, *MathWorks MATLAB* softwere is required. 
## Tasks
1. Assignment A - Solving linear algebraic equations
    -  Script programmaticly solving linear equations. It using inverted matrices with LU and LLT factorisation.  
2. Assignement B - Approximation of functions
    -   Script approximating functions with usage of least-square method. 
3. Assignement C - Solving oridinary differential equations
    - Script solving ODE's with usage of ode113 operator and Euler method.
- *All scripts also determine their indicators of uncertainaty: root-mean-square error and maximum error.*
